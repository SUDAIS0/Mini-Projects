# Mini Projects Repository

## Subjects

Here are some of the subject fields I plan to cover:

- **Operating Systems**: Exploring the design and implementation of operating systems, including process management, memory management, and file systems.
- **Computer Networks**: Understanding the principles of networking, protocols, and communication methods, including client-server architecture and network security.
- **Web Development**: Focus on building websites and web applications, covering both front-end and back-end technologies.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Exploring machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and neural networks to build intelligent systems.

## Common Programming Languages

Each project may utilize the following programming languages:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **JavaScript**: A key language for web development, enabling interactive elements on websites and server-side programming through Node.js.
- **Java**: A popular language for building platform-independent applications, especially in enterprise environments and Android development.
- **C++**: A powerful language often used in systems programming, game development, and applications requiring high performance.

## Project Naming Convention

Each project will have its own folder under the respective subject. Inside each project folder, you will find:

- **`README.md`**: (Will go under the name of prject.readme) This file will contain details about the project, including:
  - Project description
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Any additional notes or credits
  
- **`source_code`**: Usually goes under the name of PROJECT. This folder will include all the source code files for the project.

- **Other files**: Any other relevant files (data files, documentation, etc.). Will also go under the name of that project.

## Contributions
